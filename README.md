The Vessel Tree Generator module provides an automated workflow for extracting vascular
structures from volumetric brain images. It applies optional noise reduction using median
filtering, enhances vessel contrast through a sigmoid intensity transformation, and allows
interactive threshold-based segmentation with real-time preview. The resulting segmentation
can be refined by keeping only the largest connected vessel island and automatically
converted into a 3D surface model for visualization. All steps are integrated into a
streamlined interface requiring minimal user interaction.
